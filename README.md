# My-Test-Repo
Repo to Test Passing Files
back and forth between my computer and my Git Hub account.
* 1, I cloned the new My-Test_Repo file from my Git Hub account to my desktop and now I am modifying it with Notepad++.
* 2, Next I will ADD it to Git, COMMIT it to Git, and PUSH it to my Git Hub account.
* 3, OK, now I am back on GitHub, and I am editing README on GitHub. I think I have to clone it back in Git to see the change on my desktop.
* 4, Let's see if this will push to Git Hub. I am on Git on my Desktop.
* 5, OMG, I finally did it right.  The push from the desktop worked.  Now I see that I need to pull whatever the current verision is off of GitHub, change it on my desktop, then add, commit then push it back onto GitHub.
